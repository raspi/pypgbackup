Simple per database backup dump for PostgreSQL
Uses pg_dump and pg_restore

Categorizes dumps to active and non-active

Active = someone is currently using database and there's light chance that newest data might be broken. 

Some people don't know what transactions are and this might be the case:
INSERT data
SELECT something based on that INSERT
INSERT something based on last SELECT query

Now we take backup unfortynatelly in wrong time:
INSERT data
SELECT something based on that INSERT
*Take database dump here*
INSERT something based on last SELECT query

-> Database dump is broken
